 *
 * "Definitions" are the generic name for top-level statements in the document.

 * 1) Operations (such as a query)
 * 2) Fragments

 * "Operations" are a generic name for requests in the document.
 * Examples of this include:
 * 1) query,
 * 2) mutation
 *
 * "Selections" are the definitions that can appear legally and at
 * single level of the query. These include:
 * 1) field references e.g `a`
 * 2) fragment "spreads" e.g. `...c`
 * 3) inline fragment "spreads" e.g. `...on Type { a }`
