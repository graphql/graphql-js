# Contributing to graphql-js

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and
answers any questions you may have. If not, feel free to open an
[Issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/).

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and requests. Please ensure your bug
description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the
issue. The best way is to provide a reduced test case on jsFiddle or jsBin.

## Pull Requests

All active development of graphql-js happens on GitHub. We actively welcome
your [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

### Considered Changes

Since graphql-js is a reference implementation of the
[GraphQL spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/), only changes which comply
with this spec will be considered. If you have a change in mind which requires a
change to the spec, please first open an
[issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/) against the spec.

### GraphQL Specification Membership Agreement

This repository is managed by EasyCLA. Project participants must sign the free ([GraphQL Specification Membership agreement](https://preview-spec-membership.graphql.org) before making a contribution. You only need to do this one time, and it can be signed by [individual contributors](http://individual-spec-membership.graphql.org/) or their [employers](http://corporate-spec-membership.graphql.org/).

To initiate the signature process please open a PR against this repo. The EasyCLA bot will block the merge if we still need a membership agreement from you.

## Release on NPM

Releases on `16.x.x` are managed by local scripts and GitHub Actions:

git switch -c <my_release_branch>
export GH_TOKEN=<token> # required to build changelog via GitHub API requests
npm run release:prepare -- 16.x.x patch
```

Push `<my_release_branch>`, open a PR from `<my_release_branch>` to `16.x.x`,

workflow.
