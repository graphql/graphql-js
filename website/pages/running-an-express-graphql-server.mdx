sidebarTitle: Running Express + GraphQL

The simplest way to run a GraphQL API server is to use [Express](https://expressjs.com), a popular web application framework for Node.js. You will need to install two additional dependencies:

```bash
npm install express graphql-http graphql --save
```

Let's modify our “hello world” example so that it's an API server rather than a script that runs a single query. We can use the 'express' module to run a webserver, and instead of executing a query directly with the `graphql` function, we can use the `graphql-http` library to mount a GraphQL API server on the “/graphql” HTTP endpoint:

```js
var express = require('express');
var { createHandler } = require('graphql-http/lib/use/express');
var { buildSchema } = require('graphql');

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
var schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`);

// The root provides a resolver function for each API endpoint
var root = {
  hello() {
    return 'Hello world!';
  },
};

var app = express();

// Create and use the GraphQL handler.
app.all(
  '/graphql',
  createHandler({
    schema: schema,
    rootValue: root,
  }),
);

// Start the server at port
app.listen(4000);
console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql');
```

You can run this GraphQL server with:

```sh
node server.js
```

## Using GraphiQL

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is GraphQL's IDE; a great way of querying and exploring your GraphQL API.
One easy way to add it to your server is via the MIT-licensed [ruru](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/blob/main/grafast/ruru/README.md) package which bundles a prebuilt GraphiQL with some popular enhancements.
To do so, install the `ruru` module with `npm install --save ruru` and then add the following to your `server.js` file, then restart the `node server.js` command:

```js
var { ruruHTML } = require('ruru/server');

// Serve the GraphiQL IDE.
app.get('/', (_req, res) => {
  res.type('html');
  res.end(ruruHTML({ endpoint: '/graphql' }));
});
```

If you navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), you should see an interface that lets you enter queries;
now you can use the GraphiQL IDE tool to issue GraphQL queries directly in the browser.

At this point you have learned how to run a GraphQL server. The next step is to learn how to [issue GraphQL queries from client code](/graphql-clients/).
