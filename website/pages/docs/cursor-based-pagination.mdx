title: Implementing Cursor-based Pagination
---

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

When a GraphQL API returns a list of data, pagination helps avoid
fetching too much data at once. Cursor-based pagination fetches items
relative to a specific point in the list, rather than using numeric offsets.
This pattern works well with dynamic datasets, where users frequently add or
remove items between requests.

GraphQL.js doesn't include cursor pagination out of the box, but you can implement
it using custom types and resolvers. This guide shows how to build a paginated field
using the connection pattern popularized by [Relay](https://relay.dev). By the end of this 
guide, you will be able to define cursors and return results in a consistent structure 
that works well with clients.

## The connection pattern

Cursor-based pagination typically uses a structured format that separates
pagination metadata from the actual data. The most widely adopted pattern follows the
[GraphQL Cursor Connections Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm). While
this format originated in Relay, many GraphQL APIs use it independently because of its
clarity and flexibility.

This pattern wraps your list of items in a connection type, which includes the following fields:

- `edges`: A list of edge objects, representing for each item in the list:
  - `node`: The actual object you want to retrieve, such as user, post, or comment.
  - `cursor`: An opaque string that identifies the position of the item in the list.
- `pageInfo`: Metadata about the list, such as whether more items are available.

The following query and response show how this structure works:

```graphql
query {
  users(first: 2) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "users": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Ada Lovelace"
          },
          "cursor": "cursor-1"
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "Alan Turing"
          },
          "cursor": "cursor-2"
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "hasNextPage": true,
        "endCursor": "cursor-2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This structure gives clients everything they need to paginate. It provides the actual data (`node`),
the cursor to continue from (`endCursor`), and a flag (`hasNextPage`) that indicates whether
more data is available.

## Defining connection types in GraphQL.js

To support this structure in your schema, define a few custom types:

```js
const PageInfoType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'PageInfo',
  fields: {
    hasNextPage: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLBoolean) },
    hasPreviousPage: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLBoolean) },
    startCursor: { type: GraphQLString },
    endCursor: { type: GraphQLString },
  },
});
```

The `PageInfo` type provides metadata about the current page of results.
The `hasNextPage` and `hasPreviousPage` fields indicate whether more
results are available in either direction. The `startCursor` and `endCursor`
fields help clients resume pagination from a specific point.

Next, define an edge type to represent individual items in the connection:

```js
const UserEdgeType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'UserEdge',
  fields: {
    node: { type: UserType },
    cursor: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
  },
});
```

Each edge includes a `node` and a `cursor`, which marks its position in
the list.

Then, define the connection type itself:

```js
const UserConnectionType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'UserConnection',
  fields: {
    edges: {
      type: new GraphQLNonNull(
        new GraphQLList(new GraphQLNonNull(UserEdgeType))
      ),
    },
    pageInfo: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(PageInfoType) },
  },
});
```

The connection type wraps a list of edges and includes the pagination
metadata.

Paginated fields typically accept the following arguments:

```js
const connectionArgs = {
  first: { type: GraphQLInt },
  after: { type: GraphQLString },
  last: { type: GraphQLInt },
  before: { type: GraphQLString },
};
```

Use `first` and `after` for forward pagination. The `last` and `before`
arguments enable backward pagination if needed.

## Writing a paginated resolver

Once you've defined your connection types and pagination arguments, you can write a resolver
that slices your data and returns a connection object. The key steps are:

1. Decode the incoming cursor.
2. Slice the data based on the decoded index.
3. Generate cursors for each returned item.
4. Build the `edges` and `pageInfo` objects.

The exact logic will vary depending on how your data is stored. The following example uses an
in-memory list of users:

```js
// Sample data
const users = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Ada Lovelace' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Alan Turing' },
  { id: '3', name: 'Grace Hopper' },
  { id: '4', name: 'Katherine Johnson' },
];

// Encode/decode cursors
function encodeCursor(index) {
  return Buffer.from(`cursor:${index}`).toString('base64');
}

function decodeCursor(cursor) {
  const decoded = Buffer.from(cursor, 'base64').toString('ascii');
  const match = decoded.match(/^cursor:(\d+)$/);
  return match ? parseInt(match[1], 10) : null;
}

// Resolver for paginated users
const usersField = {
  type: UserConnectionType,
  args: connectionArgs,
  resolve: (_, args) => {
    let start = 0;
    if (args.after) {
      const index = decodeCursor(args.after);
      if (Number.isFinite(index)) {
        start = index + 1;
      }
    }

    const slice = users.slice(start, start + (args.first || users.length));

    const edges = slice.map((user, i) => ({
      node: user,
      cursor: encodeCursor(start + i),
    }));

    const startCursor = edges.length > 0 ? edges[0].cursor : null;
    const endCursor = edges.length > 0 ? edges[edges.length - 1].cursor : null;
    const hasNextPage = start + slice.length < users.length;
    const hasPreviousPage = start > 0;

    return {
      edges,
      pageInfo: {
        startCursor,
        endCursor,
        hasNextPage,
        hasPreviousPage,
      },
    };
  },
};
```

This resolver handles forward pagination using `first` and `after`. You can extend it to
support `last` and `before` by reversing the logic.

## Using a database for pagination

In production, you'll usually paginate data stored in a database. The same cursor-based
logic applies, but you'll translate cursors into SQL query parameters, typically
as an `OFFSET`.

The following example shows how to paginate a list of users using PostgreSQL and a Node.js
client like `pg`:

```js
import db from './db';

async function resolveUsers(_, args) {
  const limit = args.first ?? 10;
  let offset = 0;

  if (args.after) {
    const index = decodeCursor(args.after);
    if (Number.isFinite(index)) {
      offset = index + 1;
    }
  }

  const result = await db.query(
    'SELECT id, name FROM users ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT $1 OFFSET $2',
    [limit + 1, offset] // Fetch one extra row to compute hasNextPage
  );

  const slice = result.rows.slice(0, limit);
  const edges = slice.map((user, i) => ({
    node: user,
    cursor: encodeCursor(offset + i),
  }));

  const startCursor = edges.length > 0 ? edges[0].cursor : null;
  const endCursor = edges.length > 0 ? edges[edges.length - 1].cursor : null;

  return {
    edges,
    pageInfo: {
      startCursor,
      endCursor,
      hasNextPage: result.rows.length > limit,
      hasPreviousPage: offset > 0,
    },
  };
}
```

This approach supports forward pagination by translating the decoded cursor into
an `OFFSET`. To paginate backward, you can reverse the sort order and slice the
results accordingly, or use keyset pagination for improved performance on large
datasets.

<Callout type='info'>

The above is just an example to aid understanding; in a production application,
for most databases it is better to use `WHERE` clauses to implement cursor
pagination rather than using `OFFSET`. Using `WHERE` can leverage indices
(indexes) to jump directly to the relevant records, whereas `OFFSET` typically
must scan over and discard that number of records. When paginating very large
datasets, `OFFSET` can become more expensive as the value grows, whereas using
`WHERE` tends to have fixed cost. Using `WHERE` can also typically handle the
addition or removal of data more gracefully.

For example, if you were ordering a collection of users by username, you could
use the username itself as the `cursor`, thus GraphQL's `allUsers(first: 10,
after: $cursor)` could become SQL's `WHERE username > $1 LIMIT 10`. Even if
that user was deleted, you could still continue to paginate from that position
onwards.

</Callout>

## Handling edge cases

When implementing pagination, consider how your resolver should handle the following scenarios:

- **Empty result sets**: Return an empty `edges` array and a `pageInfo` object with
`hasNextPage: false` and `endCursor: null`.
- **Invalid cursors**: If decoding a cursor fails, treat it as a `null` or return an error,
depending on your API's behavior.
- **End of list**: If the requested `first` exceeds the available data, return all remaining
items and set `hasNextPage: false`.

Always test your pagination with multiple boundaries: beginning, middle, end, and out-of-bounds
errors.
