# Testing Best Practices

As your GraphQL server grows, so does the risk of regressions, inconsistencies, 
and slow development feedback. A thoughtful testing strategy helps you catch 
problems early and ship with confidence—without overwhelming your team with 
redundant or brittle tests.

This guide outlines practical testing patterns for GraphQL servers, 
including schema safety, test coverage, data management, performance, and 
continuous integration.

## Schema stability

Your schema is a contract with every client and consumer. Changes should 
be intentional and reviewed.

### Best practices

- Use snapshot tests to catch unintended schema changes  
  – Tool: [`jest-serializer-graphql-schema`](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/jest-serializer-graphql-schema)  
  – Example:
    ```ts
    expect(printSchema(schema)).toMatchSnapshot();
    ```
- Use schema diff tools in CI:
  - `graphql-inspector`
  - Apollo Rover
  - GraphQL Hive
- Require review or approval for breaking changes
- Treat schema changes like semver: breaking changes should be explicit and 
intentional

## Focus test coverage

You don’t need 100% coverage, you need meaningful coverage. Prioritize 
behavior that matters.

### Best practices

- Test high-value paths:
    - Business logic and custom resolver behavior
    - Error cases: invalid input, auth failures, fallback logic
    - Nullable fields and partial success cases
    - Integration between fields, arguments, and data dependencies
- Coverage strategy:
    - Unit test resolvers with significant logic
    - Integration test operations end-to-end
    - Avoid duplicating tests across layers
    - Use tools to identify gaps:
        - `graphql-coverage`
        - Jest `--coverage`
        - Static analysis for unused fields/resolvers

## Managing test data

Clean, flexible test data makes your tests easier to write, read, and 
maintain.

### Best practices

- Use factories instead of hardcoding:

  ```ts
  function createUser(overrides = {}) {
    return { id: '1', name: 'Test User', ...overrides };
  }

- Share fixtures:

    ```ts
    export function createTestContext(overrides = {}) {
  return {
    db: { findUser: jest.fn() },
    ...overrides,
  };
}

- Keep test data small and expressive
- Avoid coupling test data to real database structures 
unless explicitly testing integration

## Keep tests fast and isolated

Slow tests kill iteration speed. Fast tests build confidence.

To keep tests lean:

- Use `graphql()` instead of spinning up a server
- Use in-memory or mock data—avoid real databases in most tests
- Group tests by concern: resolver, operation, schema
- Use parallelization (e.g., Jest, Vitest)
- Avoid shared state or global mocks that leak across test files

For large test suites:

- Split tests by service or domain
- Cache expensive steps where possible

## Integrate tests into CI

Tests are only useful if they run consistently and early.

### Best practices

- Run tests on every push or PR:
    - Lint GraphQL files and scalars
    - Run resolver and operation tests
    - Validate schema via snapshot or diff
- Fail fast:
    - Break the build on schema snapshot diffs
    - Block breaking changes without a migration plan
- Use GitHub annotations or reporters to surface failures in PRs

## Lint your schema

Testing behavior is only the start. Clean, consistent schemas are 
easier to maintain and consume.

Use schema linting to enforce:

- Descriptions on public fields and types
- Consistent naming and casing
- Deprecation patterns
- Nullability rules

Tools:

- `graphql-schema-linter`
- `eslint-plugin-graphql`
