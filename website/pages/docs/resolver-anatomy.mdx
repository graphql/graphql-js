# Anatomy of a Resolver

In GraphQL.js, a resolver is a function that returns the value for a 
specific field in a schema. Resolvers connect a GraphQL query to the 
underlying data or logic needed to fulfill it.

This guide breaks down the anatomy of a resolver, how GraphQL.js uses 
them during query execution, and best practices for writing them effectively.

## What is a resolver?

A resolver is responsible for returning the value for a specific field in a 
GraphQL query. During execution, GraphQL.js calls a resolver for each field, 
either using a custom function you provide or falling back to a default 
behavior.

If no resolver is provided, GraphQL.js tries to retrieve a property from the 
parent object that matches the field name. If the property is a function, it 
calls the function and uses the result. Otherwise, it returns the property 
value directly.

You can think of a resolver as a translator between the schema and the 
actual data. The schema defines what can be queried, while resolvers 
determine how to fetch or compute the data at runtime.

## Resolver function signature

When GraphQL.js executes a resolver, it calls the resolver function 
with four arguments:

```js
function resolve(source, args, context, info) { ... }
```

Each argument provides information that can help the resolver return the
correct value:

- `source`: The result from the parent field's resolver. In nested fields,
`source` contains the value returned by the parent object (after resolving any
lists). For root fields, it is the `rootValue` passed to GraphQL, which is often
left `undefined`.
- `args`: An object containing the arguments passed to the field in the
query. For example, if a field is defined to accept an `id` argument, you can
access it as `args.id`.
- `context`: A shared object available to every resolver in an operation. 
It is commonly used to store per-request state like authentication
information, database connections, or caching utilities.
- `info`: Information about the current execution state, including
the field name, path to the field from the root, the return type, the parent
type, and the full schema. It is mainly useful for advanced scenarios such
as query optimization or logging.

Resolvers can use any combination of these arguments, depending on the needs
of the field they are resolving.

## Default resolvers

If you do not provide a resolver for a field, GraphQL.js uses a built-in
default resolver called `defaultFieldResolver`.

The default behavior is simple:

- It looks for a property on the `source` object that matches the name of
the field.
- If the property exists and is a function, it calls the function and uses the
result.
- Otherwise, it returns the property value directly.

This default resolution makes it easy to build simple schemas without 
writing custom resolvers for every field. For example, if your `source` object 
already contains fields with matching names, GraphQL.js can resolve them 
automatically.

You can override the default behavior by specifying a `resolve` function when 
defining a field in the schema. This is necessary when the fieldâ€™s value 
needs to be computed dynamically, fetched from an external service, or 
otherwise requires custom logic.

## Writing a custom resolver

A custom resolver is a function you define to control exactly how a field's 
value is fetched or computed. You can add a resolver by specifying a `resolve` 
function when defining a field in your schema:

```js {6-8}
const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: {
    fullName: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      resolve(source) {
        return `${source.firstName} ${source.lastName}`;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Resolvers can be synchronous or asynchronous. If a resolver returns a 
Promise, GraphQL.js automatically waits for the Promise to resolve before 
continuing execution:

```js
resolve(source, args, context) {
  return database.getUserById(args.id);
}
```

Custom resolvers are often used to implement patterns such as batching, 
caching, or delegation. For example, a resolver might use a batching utility 
like DataLoader to fetch multiple related records efficiently, or delegate 
part of the query to another API or service.

## Best practices

When writing resolvers, it's important to keep them focused and maintainable:

- Keep business logic separate. A resolver should focus on fetching or 
computing the value for a field, not on implementing business rules or 
complex workflows. Move business logic into separate service layers 
whenever possible.
- Handle errors carefully. Resolvers should catch and handle errors 
appropriately, either by throwing GraphQL errors or returning `null` values 
when fields are nullable. Avoid letting unhandled errors crash the server.
- Use context effectively. Store shared per-request information, such as 
authentication data or database connections, in the `context` object rather 
than passing it manually between resolvers.
- Prefer batching over nested requests. For fields that trigger multiple 
database or API calls, use batching strategies to minimize round trips and 
improve performance. A common solution for batching in GraphQL is [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader).
- Keep resolvers simple. Aim for resolvers to be small, composable functions 
that are easy to read, test, and reuse.

Following these practices helps keep your GraphQL server reliable, efficient, 
and easy to maintain as your schema grows.
