GraphQL.js is the official JavaScript implementation of the 
[GraphQL Specification](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/). It provides the core building blocks 
for constructing GraphQL servers, clients, tools, and utilities in JavaScript and TypeScript.

This documentation site is for developers who want to:

- Understand how GraphQL works
- Build a GraphQL API using GraphQL.js
- Extend, customize, or introspect GraphQL systems
- Learn best practices for using GraphQL.js in production

Whether you're writing your own server, building a GraphQL clients, or creating tools
that work with GraphQL, this site guides you through core concepts, APIs, and
advanced use cases of GraphQL.js.

## How to use this documentation

To follow along with the code examples in this documentation, make sure your environment
meets the following requirements.

### Environment

Most code examples use modern JavaScript with [ES module (ESM) syntax](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). We recommend:

- Node.js 22.7 or later, which supports automatic module type detection
    - [Download Node.js 22.7+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
- Enable ESM by either:
    - Adding `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`, or
    - Using the `.mjs` file extension

If you're using an older version of Node.js or prefer CommonJS, you may need to
adjust the code examples accordingly.

### Installation

Before running any code examples, install the GraphQL.js package:

```bash
npm install graphql
```

You'll see reminders about environment setup throughout the documentation, but this setup
is assumed by default.
