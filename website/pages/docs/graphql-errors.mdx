# Understanding GraphQL.js Errors

When executing a GraphQL operation, a server might encounter problems, such as failing to fetch 
data, encountering invalid arguments, or running into unexpected internal issues. Instead of 
crashing or halting execution, GraphQL.js collects these problems as structured errors 
and includes them in the response.

This guide explains how GraphQL.js represents errors internally, how errors propagate through a 
query, and how you can customize error behavior.

## How GraphQL.js represents errors in a response

If an error occurs during execution, GraphQL.js includes it in a top-level `errors` array in the
response, alongside any successfully returned data.

For example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User not found",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["user"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each error object can include the following fields:

- `message`: A human-readable description of the error.
- `locations` (optional): Where the error occurred in the operation.
- `path` (optional): The path to the field that caused the error.
- `extensions` (optional): Additional error metadata, often used for error codes, HTTP status
codes or debugging information.

The GraphQL specification only requires the `message` field. All others are optional, but 
recommended to help clients understand and react to errors.

## Creating and handling errors with `GraphQLError`

Internally, GraphQL.js represents errors with the `GraphQLError` class, found in the
`graphql/error` module.

You can create a `GraphQLError` manually:

```js
import { GraphQLError } from 'graphql';

throw new GraphQLError('Something went wrong');
```

To provide more context about an error, you can pass additional options:

```js
throw new GraphQLError('Invalid input', {
  nodes,
  source,
  positions,
  path,
  originalError,
  extensions,
});
```

Each option helps tie the error to specific parts of the GraphQL execution:

- `nodes`: The AST nodes associated with the error.
- `source` and `positions`: The source document and character offsets.
- `path`: The field path leading to the error.
- `originalError`: The underlying JavaScript error, if available.
- `extensions`: Any custom metadata you want to include.

When a resolver throws an error:

- If the thrown value is already a `GraphQLError`, GraphQL.js uses it as-is.
- If it is another type of error (such as a built-in `Error`), GraphQL.js wraps it into a
`GraphQLError`.

This ensures that all errors returned to the client follow a consistent structure.

## How errors propagate during execution

Errors in GraphQL don't necessarily abort the entire operation. How an error affects the response
depends on the nullability of the field where the error occurs.

- **Nullable fields**: If a resolver for a nullable field throws an error, GraphQL.js records
the error and sets the field's value to `null` in the `data` payload.
- **Non-nullable fields**: If a resolver for a non-nullable field throws an error, GraphQL.js
records the error and then sets the nearest parent nullable field to `null`.

For example, consider the following schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  user: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

If the `name` resolver throws an error during execution:

- Because `name` is non-nullable (`String!`), GraphQL.js can't return `null` for just that field.
- Instead, the `user` field itself becomes `null`.
- The error is recorded and included in the response.

The result looks like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Failed to fetch user's name",
      "path": ["user", "name"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This behavior ensures that non-nullability guarantees are respected even in the presence of errors.

For more detailed rules, see the [GraphQL Specification on error handling](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Errors).

## Customizing errors with `extensions`

You can add additional information to errors using the `extensions` field. This is useful for
passing structured metadata like error codes, HTTP status codes, or debugging hints.

For example:

```js
throw new GraphQLError('Unauthorized', {
  extensions: {
    code: 'UNAUTHORIZED',
    http: {
      status: 401
    }
  }
});
```

Clients can inspect the `extensions` field instead of relying on parsing `message` strings.

Common use cases for `extensions` include:

- Assigning machine-readable error codes (`code: 'BAD_USER_INPUT'`)
- Specifying HTTP status codes
- Including internal debug information (hidden from production clients)

Libraries like [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/errors/) and 
[Envelop](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/envelop/plugins/use-error-handler) offer conventions for 
structured error extensions, if you want to adopt standardized patterns.

## Best practices for error handling

- Write clear, actionable messages. Error messages should help developers understand what went 
wrong and how to fix it.
- Use error codes in extensions. Define a set of stable, documented error codes for your API 
to make client-side error handling easier.
- Avoid leaking internal details. Do not expose stack traces, database errors, or other 
sensitive information to clients.
- Wrap unexpected errors. Catch and wrap low-level exceptions to ensure that all errors passed 
through your GraphQL server follow the `GraphQLError` structure.

In larger servers, you might centralize error handling with a custom error formatting function
to enforce these best practices consistently.
