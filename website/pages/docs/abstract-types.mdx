title: Abstract types in GraphQL.js
---

GraphQL includes two kinds of abstract types: interfaces and unions. These types let a single
field return values of different object types, while keeping your schema type-safe.

This guide covers how to define and resolve abstract types using GraphQL.js. It focuses on 
constructing types in JavaScript using the GraphQL.js type system, not the schema definition
language (SDL).

## What are abstract types?

Most GraphQL types are concrete. They represent a specific kind of object, for example, a
`Book` or an `Author`. Abstract types let a field return different types of objects depending
on the data.

This is useful when the return type can vary but comes from a known set. For example, a `search`
field might return a book, an author, or a publisher. Abstract types let you model this kind of
flexibility while preserving validation, introspection, and tool support.

GraphQL provides two kinds of abstract types:

- Interfaces define a set of fields that multiple object types must implement.
    - Use case: A `ContentItem` interface with fields like `id`, `title`, and `publishedAt`,
    implemented by types such as `Article` and `PodcastEpisode`.
- Unions group together unrelated types that don't share any fields.
    - Use case: A `SearchResult` union that includes `Book`, `Author`, and `Publisher` types.

## Defining interfaces

To define an interface in GraphQL.js, use the `GraphQLInterfaceType` constructor. An interface
must include a `name`, a `fields` function, and a `resolveType` function, which tells GraphQL which
concrete type a given value corresponds to.

The following example defines a `ContentItem` interface for a publishing platform:

```js
const { GraphQLInterfaceType, GraphQLString, GraphQLNonNull } = require('graphql');

const ContentItemInterface = new GraphQLInterfaceType({
  name: 'ContentItem',
  fields: {
    id: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
    title: { type: GraphQLString },
    publishedAt: { type: GraphQLString },
  },
  resolveType(value) {
    if (value.audioUrl) {
      return 'PodcastEpisode';
    }
    if (value.bodyText) {
      return 'Article';
    }
    return null;
  },
});
```

You can return either the type name as a string or the corresponding `GraphQLObjectType` instance.
Returning the instance is recommended when possible for better type safety and tooling support.

## Implementing interfaces with object types

To implement an interface, define a `GraphQLObjectType` and include the interface in its
`interfaces` array. The object type must implement all fields defined by the interface.

The following example implements the `Article` and `PodcastEpisode` types that
conform to the `ContentItem` interface:

```js
const { GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString, GraphQLNonNull } = require('graphql');

const ArticleType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Article',
  interfaces: [ContentItemInterface],
  fields: {
    id: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
    title: { type: GraphQLString },
    publishedAt: { type: GraphQLString },
    bodyText: { type: GraphQLString },
  },
  isTypeOf: (value) => value.bodyText !== undefined,
});

const PodcastEpisodeType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'PodcastEpisode',
  interfaces: [ContentItemInterface],
  fields: {
    id: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
    title: { type: GraphQLString },
    publishedAt: { type: GraphQLString },
    audioUrl: { type: GraphQLString },
  },
  isTypeOf: (value) => value.audioUrl !== undefined,
});
```

The `isTypeOf` function is optional. It provides a fallback when `resolveType` isn't defined, or
when runtime values could match multiple types. If both `resolveType` and `isTypeOf` are defined,
GraphQL uses `resolveType`.

## Defining union types

Use the `GraphQLUnionType` constructor to define a union. A union allows a field to return one
of several object types that don't need to share fields.

A union requires:

- A `name`
- A list of object types (`types`)
- A `resolveType` function

The following example defines a `SearchResult` union:

```js
const { GraphQLUnionType } = require('graphql');

const SearchResultType = new GraphQLUnionType({
  name: 'SearchResult',
  types: [BookType, AuthorType, PublisherType],
  resolveType(value) {
    if (value.isbn) {
      return 'Book';
    }
    if (value.bio) {
      return 'Author';
    }
    if (value.catalogSize) {
      return 'Publisher';
    }
    return null;
  },
});
```

Unlike interfaces, unions donâ€™t declare any fields of their own. Clients use inline fragments 
to query fields from the concrete types.

## Resolving abstract types at runtime

GraphQL resolves abstract types dynamically during execution using the `resolveType` function.

This function receives the following arguments:

```js
resolveType(value, context, info)
```

It can return:

- A `GraphQLObjectType` instance (recommended)
- The name of a type as a string
- A `Promise` resolving to either of the above

If `resolveType` isn't defined, GraphQL falls back to checking each possible type's `isTypeOf` 
function. This fallback is less efficient and makes type resolution harder to debug. For most cases,
explicitly defining `resolveType` is recommended.

## Querying abstract types

To query a field that returns an abstract type, use inline fragments to select fields from the 
possible concrete types. GraphQL evaluates each fragment based on the runtime type of the result.

For example:

```graphql
{
  search(term: "deep learning") {
    ... on Book {
      title
      isbn
    }
    ... on Author {
      name
      bio
    }
    ... on Publisher {
      name
      catalogSize
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL's introspection system lists all possible types for each interface and union, which
enables code generation and editor tooling to provide type-aware completions.

## Best practices

- Always implement `resolveType` for interfaces and unions to handle runtime type resolution.
- Return the `GraphQLObjectType` instance when possible for better clarity and static analysis.
- Keep `resolveType` logic simple, using consistent field shapes or tags to distinguish
types.
- Test `resolveType` logic carefully. Errors in `resolveType` can cause runtime errors that can 
be hard to trace.
- Use interfaces when types share fields and unions when types are structurally unrelated.
