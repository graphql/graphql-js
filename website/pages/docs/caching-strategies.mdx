# Caching Strategies

Caching is a core strategy for improving the performance and scalability of GraphQL
servers. Because GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what they need, the server often
does more work per request compared to REST APIs.

This guide explores different levels of caching in a GraphQL.js so you can apply the right
strategy for your application.

## Why caching matters

GraphQL servers commonly face performance bottlenecks due to repeated fetching of the
same data, costly resolver logic, or expensive database queries. Since GraphQL shifts
much of the composition responsibility to the server, caching becomes essential for maintaining
fast response times and managing backend load.

## Caching levels

There are several opportunities to apply caching within a GraphQL server:

- **Resolver-level caching**: Cache the result of specific fields.
- **Request-level caching**: Batch and cache repeated access to backend resources
within a single operation.
- **Operation result caching**: Reuse the entire response for repeated identical queries.
- **Schema caching**: Cache the compiled schema when startup cost is high.
- **Transport/middleware caching**: Leverage caching behavior in HTTP servers or proxies.

Understanding where caching fits in your application flow helps you apply it strategically
without overcomplicating your system.

## Resolver-level caching

Resolver-level caching is useful when a specific field’s value is expensive to compute and 
commonly requested with the same arguments. Instead of recomputing or refetching the data on 
every request, you can store the result temporarily in memory and return it directly when the 
same input appears again.

### Use cases

- Fields backed by slow or rate-limited APIs
- Fields that require complex computation
- Data that doesn't change frequently

For example, consider a field that returns information about a product:

```js
// utils/cache.js
import LRU from 'lru-cache';

export const productCache = new LRU({ max: 1000, ttl: 1000 * 60 }); // 1 min TTL
```

The next example shows how to use that cache inside a resolver to avoid repeated database
lookups:

```js
// resolvers/product.js
import { productCache } from '../utils/cache.js';

export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async product(_, { id }, context) {
      const cached = productCache.get(id);
      if (cached) return cached;

      const product = await context.db.products.findById(id);
      productCache.set(id, product);
      return product;
    },
  },
};
```

This example uses [`lru-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache), which limits the 
number of stored items and support TTL-based expiration. You can replace it with Redis or 
another cache if you need cross-process consistency.

### Guidelines

- Resolver-level caches are global. Be careful with authorization-sensitive data.
- This technique works best for data that doesn't change often or can tolerate short-lived
staleness.
- TTL should match how often the underlying data is expected to change.

## Request-level caching with DataLoader

[DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) is a utility for batching and caching
backend access during a single GraphQL operation. It's designed to solve the N+1 problem,
where the same resource is fetched repeatedly in a single query across multiple fields.

### Use cases

- Resolving nested relationships
- Avoiding duplicate database or API calls
- Scoping caching to a single request, without persisting globally

The following example defines a DataLoader instance that batches user lookups by ID:

```js
// loaders/userLoader.js
import DataLoader from 'dataloader';
import { batchGetUsers } from '../services/users.js';

export const createUserLoader = () => new DataLoader(ids => batchGetUsers(ids));
```

You can then include the loader in the per-request context to isolate it from other
operations:

```js
// context.js
import { createUserLoader } from './loaders/userLoader.js';

export function createContext() {
  return {
    userLoader: createUserLoader(),
  };
}
```

Finally, use the loader in your resolvers to batch-fetch users efficiently:

```js
// resolvers/user.js
export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async users(_, __, context) {
      return context.userLoader.loadMany([1, 2, 3]);
    },
  },
};
```

### Guidelines

- The cache is scoped to the request. Each request gets a fresh loader instance.
- This strategy works best for resolving repeated references to the same resource type.
- This isn't a long-lived cache. Combine it with other layers for broader coverage.

## Operation result caching

Operation result caching stores the complete response of a query, keyed by the query string, variables, and potentially 
HTTP headers. It can dramatically improve performance when the same query is sent frequently, particularly for read-heavy 
applications.

### Use cases

- Public data or anonymous content
- Expensive queries that return stable results
- Scenarios where the same query is sent frequently

The following example defines two functions to interact with a Redis cache,
storing and retrieving cached results:

```js
// cache/queryCache.js
import Redis from 'ioredis';
const redis = new Redis();

export async function getCachedResponse(cacheKey) {
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;
}

export async function cacheResponse(cacheKey, result, ttl = 60) {
  await redis.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(result), 'EX', ttl);
}
```

The next example shows how to wrap your execution logic to check the cache first and store results
afterward:

```js
// graphql/executeWithCache.js
import { getCachedResponse, cacheResponse } from '../cache/queryCache.js';

export async function executeWithCache({ cacheKey, executeFn }) {
  const cached = await getCachedResponse(cacheKey);
  if (cached) return cached;

  const result = await executeFn();
  await cacheResponse(cacheKey, result);
  return result;
}
```

### Guidelines

- Don't cache personalized or auth-sensitive data unless you scope the cache per user or token.
- Invalidation is nontrivial. Consider TTLs, cache versioning, or event-driven purging.

## Schema caching

Schema caching is useful when your schema construction is expensive, for example, when
you have dynamically generating types, you are stitching multiple schemas, or fetching
remote GraphQL services. This is especially important in serverless environments,
where cold starts can significantly impact performance.

### Use cases

- Serverless functions that rebuild the schema on each invocation
- Applications that use schema stitching or remote schema delegation
- Environments where schema generation takes noticeable time on startup

The following example shows how to cache a schema in memory after the first build:

```js
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql';

let cachedSchema;

export function getSchema() {
  if (!cachedSchema) {
    cachedSchema = buildSchema(schemaSDLString); // or makeExecutableSchema()
  }
  return cachedSchema;
}
```

## Cache invalidation

No caching strategy is complete without an invalidation plan. Cached data can
become stale or incorrect, and serving outdated information can lead to bugs or a 
degraded user experience.

The following are common invalidation techniques:

- **TTL (time-to-live)**: Automatically expire cached items after a time window
- **Manual purging**: Remove or refresh cache entries when related data is updated
- **Key versioning**: Encode version or timestamp metadata into cache keys
- **Stale-while-revalidate**: Serve stale data while refreshing it in the background

Design your invalidation strategy based on your data’s volatility and your clients’ 
tolerance for staleness.

## Third-party and edge caching

While GraphQL.js does not include built-in support for third-party or edge caching, it integrates 
well with external tools and middleware that handle full response caching or caching by query 
signature.

### Use cases

- Serving public, cacheable content to unauthenticated users
- Deploying behind a CDN or reverse proxy
- Using a gateway service that supports persistent response caching

The following tools and layers are commonly used:

- Redis or Memcached for in-memory and cross-process caching
- CDN-level caching for static, cache-friendly GraphQL queries
- API gateways

### Guidelines

- Partition cache entries for personalized data using auth tokens or headers
- Monitor cache hit/miss ratios to identify tuning opportunities
- Consider varying cache strategy per query or operation type

## Client-side caching

GraphQL clients include sophisticated client-side caches that store 
normalized query results and reuse them across views or components. While this is out of scope for GraphQL.js 
itself, server-side caching should be designed with client behavior in mind.

### When to consider it in server design

- You want to avoid redundant server work for cold-started clients
- You need consistency between server and client freshness guarantees
- You're coordinating with clients that rely on local cache behavior

Server-side and client-side caches should align on freshness guarantees and invalidation
behavior. If the client doesn't re-fetch automatically, server-side staleness
may be invisible but impactful.
