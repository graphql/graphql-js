title: Solving the N+1 Problem with `DataLoader`
---

When building your first server with GraphQL.js, it's common to encounter
performance issues related to the N+1 problem: a pattern that 
results in many unnecessary database or service calls, 
especially in nested query structures.

This guide explains what the N+1 problem is, why it's relevant in
GraphQL field resolution, and how to address it using
[`DataLoader`](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader).

## What is the N+1 problem?

The N+1 problem happens when your API fetches a list of items using one
query, and then issues an additional query for each item in the list.
In GraphQL, this usually occurs in nested field resolvers.

For example, in the following query:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

If the `posts` field returns 10 items, and each `author` field fetches
the author by ID with a separate database call, the server performs
11 total queries: one to fetch the posts, and one for each post's author
(10 total authors). As the number of parent items increases, the number
of database calls grows, which can degrade performance.

Even if several posts share the same author, the server will still issue
duplicate queries unless you implement deduplication or batching manually.

## Why this happens in GraphQL.js

In GraphQL.js, each field resolver runs independently. There's no built-in
coordination between resolvers, and no automatic batching. This makes field
resolvers composable and predictable, but it also creates the N+1 problem.
Nested resolutions, such as fetching an author for each post in the previous
example, will each call their own data-fetching logic, even if those calls
could be grouped.

## Solving the problem with `DataLoader`

[`DataLoader`](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) is a utility library designed
to solve this problem. It batches multiple `.load(key)` calls into a single `batchLoadFn(keys)` 
call and caches results during the life of a request. This means you can reduce redundant data
fetches and group related lookups into efficient operations.

To use `DataLoader` in a `graphql-js` server:

1. Create `DataLoader` instances for each request.
2. Attach the instance to the `contextValue` passed to GraphQL execution. You can attach the 
loader when calling [`graphql()`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/graphql/#graphql) directly, or 
when setting up a GraphQL HTTP server such as [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql).
3. Use `.load(id)` in resolvers to fetch data through the loader.

### Example: Batching author lookups

Suppose each `Post` has an `authorId`, and you have a `getUsersByIds(ids)`
function that can fetch multiple users in a single call:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js {14-17,37}
import {
  graphql,
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLSchema,
  GraphQLString,
  GraphQLList,
  GraphQLID
} from 'graphql';
import DataLoader from 'dataloader';
import { getPosts, getUsersByIds } from './db.js';

function createContext() {
  return {
    userLoader: new DataLoader(async (userIds) => {
      const users = await getUsersByIds(userIds);
      return userIds.map(id => users.find(user => user.id === id));
    }),
  };
}

const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: () => ({
    id: { type: GraphQLID },
    name: { type: GraphQLString },
  }),
});

const PostType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Post',
  fields: () => ({
    id: { type: GraphQLID },
    title: { type: GraphQLString },
    author: {
      type: UserType,
      resolve(post, args, context) {
        return context.userLoader.load(post.authorId);
      },
    },
  }),
});

const QueryType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  fields: () => ({
    posts: {
      type: GraphQLList(PostType),
      resolve: () => getPosts(),
    },
  }),
});

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({ query: QueryType });
```

With this setup, all `.load(authorId)` calls are automatically collected and batched
into a single call to `getUsersByIds`. `DataLoader` also caches results for the duration
of the request, so repeated `.load(id)` calls for the same ID don't trigger
additional fetches.

## Best practices

- Create a new `DataLoader` instance per request. This ensures that caching is scoped
correctly and avoids leaking data between users.
- Always return results in the same order as the input keys. This is required by the
`DataLoader` contract. If a key is not found, return `null` or throw depending on
your policy.
- Keep batch functions focused. Each loader should handle a specific data access pattern.
- Use `.loadMany()` sparingly. While it's useful when you already have a list of IDs, it's
typically not needed in field resolvers, since `.load()` already batches individual calls
made within the same execution cycle.
