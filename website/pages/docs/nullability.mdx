# Nullability in GraphQL.js

Nullability is a core concept in GraphQL that affects how schemas are defined,
how execution behaves, and how clients interpret results. In GraphQL.js,
nullability plays a critical role in both schema construction and
runtime behavior.

This guide explains how nullability works, how it's represented in GraphQL.js,
and how to design schemas with nullability in mind.

## How nullability works

In GraphQL, fields are nullable by default. This means if a resolver function
returns `null`, the result will include a `null` value unless the field is
explicitly marked as non-nullable. 

When a non-nullable field resolves to `null`, the GraphQL execution engine 
raises a runtime error and attempts to recover by replacing the nearest 
nullable parent field with `null`. This behavior is known
as null bubbling.

Understanding nullability requires familiarity with the GraphQL type system,
execution semantics, and the trade-offs involved in schema design.

## The role of `GraphQLNonNull`

GraphQL.js represents non-nullability using the `GraphQLNonNull` wrapper type.
By default, all fields are nullable:

```js
import {
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLString,
  GraphQLNonNull,
} from 'graphql';

const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: () => ({
    id: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
    email: { type: GraphQLString },
  }),
});
```

In this example, the `id` field is non-nullable, meaning it must always
resolve to a string. The `email` field is nullable.

You can use `GraphQLNonNull` with:

- Field types
- Argument types
- Input object fields
- Return types for resolvers

You can also combine it with other types to create more
specific constraints. For example:

```js
new GraphQLNonNull(new GraphQLList(new GraphQLNonNull(UserType)))
```

This structure corresponds to [User!]! in SDL: a non-nullable list of non-null
`User` values. When reading code like this, work from the inside out: `UserType`
is non-nullable, and wrapped in a list, which is itself non-nullable.

## Execution behavior

GraphQL.js uses nullability rules to determine how to handle `null` values
at runtime:

- If a nullable field returns `null`, the result includes that field with
a `null` value.
- If a non-nullable field returns `null`, GraphQL throws an error and
sets the nearest nullable parent field to `null`.

This bubbling behavior prevents partial data from being returned in cases where
a non-nullable guarantee is violated.

Here's an example that shows this in action:

```js
import {
  GraphQLSchema,
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLString,
  GraphQLNonNull,
} from 'graphql';

const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: {
    id: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
  },
});

const QueryType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  fields: {
    user: {
      type: UserType,
      resolve: () => ({ id: null }),
    },
  },
});

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({ query: QueryType });
```

In this example, the `user` field returns an object with `id: null`.
Because `id` is non-nullable, GraphQL can't return `user.id`, and instead
nullifies the `user` field entirely. An error describing the violation is
added to the `errors` array in the response.

## Schema design considerations

Using non-null types communicates clear expectations to clients, but it's
also less forgiving. When deciding whether to use `GraphQLNonNull`, keep
the following in mind:

- Use non-null types when a value is always expected. This reflects intent
and reduces ambiguity for clients.
- Avoid aggressive use of non-null types in early schema versions. It limits
your ability to evolve the API later.
- Be cautious of error bubbling. A `null` return from a deeply nested non-nullable
field can affect large portions of the response.

### Versioning

Non-null constraints are part of a field's contract:

- Changing a field from non-nullable to nullable is a breaking change.
- Changing from nullable to non-nullable is also breaking unless you can
guarantee that the field will never return `null`.

To reduce the risk of versioning issues, start with nullable fields and add
constraints as your schema matures.

## Using `GraphQLNonNull` in schema and resolvers

Let's walk through two practical scenarios that show how GraphQL.js enforces
nullability.

### Defining a non-null field

This example defines a `Product` type with a non-nullable `name` field:

```js
import { GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString, GraphQLNonNull } from 'graphql';

const ProductType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Product',
  fields: () => ({
    name: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
  }),
});
```

This configuration guarantees that `name` must always be a string
and never `null`. If a resolver returns `null` for this field, an
error will be thrown.

### Resolver returns `null` for a non-null field

In this example, the resolver returns an object with `name: null`, violating
the non-null constraint:

```js
import {
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLString,
  GraphQLNonNull,
  GraphQLSchema,
} from 'graphql';

const ProductType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Product',
  fields: {
    name: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
  },
});

const QueryType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  fields: {
    product: {
      type: ProductType,
      resolve: () => ({ name: null }),
    },
  },
});

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({ query: QueryType });
```

In this example, the `product` resolver returns an object with `name: null`.
Because the `name` field is non-nullable, GraphQL.js responds by
nullifying the entire `product` field and appending a 
corresponding error to the response.

## Best practices

- Default to nullable. Start with nullable fields and introduce non-null
constraints when data consistency is guaranteed.
- Express intent. Use non-null when a field must always be present for logical
correctness.
- Validate early. Add checks in resolvers to prevent returning `null` for
non-null fields.
- Watch for nesting. Distinguish between:
    - `[User]!` - nullable list of non-null users
    - `[User!]!` - non-null list of non-null users
